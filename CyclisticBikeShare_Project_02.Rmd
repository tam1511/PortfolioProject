## Descriptive Analysis
*The number of each ride type user
```{r}
table(all_trips_v2$member_casual)
```
In total of 5,439,347 users id, there has 2,456,602 casual users and 2,982,745 member users

*Ride length data

```{r}
summary(all_trips_v2$ride_length)
```
As we can see above the description of ride length data 75% riders ride for 1291 seconds but the maximum ride length is 3356649 seconds.

### Compare members and casual users according to ride length 
```{r}
aggregate(all_trips_v2$ride_length ~ all_trips_v2$member_casual, FUN = mean)
aggregate(all_trips_v2$ride_length ~ all_trips_v2$member_casual, FUN = median)
aggregate(all_trips_v2$ride_length ~ all_trips_v2$member_casual, FUN = max)
aggregate(all_trips_v2$ride_length ~ all_trips_v2$member_casual, FUN = min)
```


The average in ride length of casual riders is 1902s higher than member riders (807.7s)
The median ride length of casual riders is 949s, and member riders is 568s
The maximum ride time of casual riders (3356649s) is much higher than member riders (89998s)


### Next see the average ride time by each day for members and casual users
```{r}
aggregate(all_trips_v2$ride_length ~ all_trips_v2$member_casual + all_trips_v2$day_of_week, FUN = mean)
```

```{r}
# The day of week are out of order
all_trips_v2$day_of_week <- ordered(all_trips_v2$day_of_week, levels = c("Sunday","Monday", "Tuesday","Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"))
# Now run again
memory.size()
memory.limit()
memory.limit(size=56000)
aggregate(all_trips_v2$ride_length ~ all_trips_v2$member_casual + all_trips_v2$day_of_week, FUN = mean)
```

### Analyze ridership data by type and weekday
```{r}
# See the number of rides and average duration by type during weekday
all_trips_v2 %>% 
  mutate(weekday = wday(started_at, label = TRUE)) %>% 
  group_by(member_casual, weekday) %>% 
  summarise(number_of_riders = n(), average_duration = mean(ride_length)) %>% 
  arrange(member_casual, weekday)
  
```

### Create Visualization for number of riders by type
* Number of riders on weekday
```{r fig.height=3}
# Create a graph to visualize the number of riders by ride type during weekday
all_trips_v2 %>% 
  mutate(weekday = wday(started_at, label = TRUE)) %>% 
  group_by(member_casual, weekday) %>% 
  summarize(number_of_rides = n(), average_duration = mean(ride_length)) %>% 
  arrange(member_casual,weekday) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = weekday, y = number_of_rides, fill = member_casual)) + geom_col(position = "dodge")
```
From the chart above we can see the clearly difference only for casual users ride highly on Saturday and then Sunday Whereas member of users use bike at the almost constant rate during the week.

* Number of riders per day
```{r fig.width= 4, fig.width=7}
all_trips_v2 %>% 
  group_by(member_casual, day) %>% 
  summarize(number_of_rides = n(), average_duration = mean(ride_length)) %>% 
  arrange(member_casual,day) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = day, y = number_of_rides,group = member_casual, color = member_casual)) + geom_line()
```
We can certainly say members use bikes more often than casual in general. 

* Number of riders per month
```{r fig.width= 4, fig.width=5}
all_trips_v2 %>% 
  group_by(member_casual, month) %>% 
  summarize(number_of_rides = n(), average_duration = mean(ride_length)) %>% 
  arrange(member_casual,month) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = month, y = number_of_rides,group = member_casual, color = member_casual)) + geom_line()
```
From line plot above we can see members use bikes more often than casual however casual users have dramatic rise from June 2021 to August 2021. 

### Create Visualization for rider length
*Usage of ride type based on ride length per week
```{r fig.height= 3}
# Create a graph to visualize the average duration by type during weekday
all_trips_v2 %>% 
  mutate(weekday = wday(started_at, label = TRUE)) %>% 
  group_by(member_casual, weekday) %>% 
  summarize(number_of_rides = n(), average_duration = mean(ride_length)) %>% 
  arrange(member_casual,weekday) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = weekday, y = average_duration, fill = member_casual)) + geom_col(position = "dodge")
```
The above graph shows the clearly understanding about the average ride length. Casual type users ride much longer and as expected weekend got the higher ride length than others.

*Usage of ride type based on ride length per day
```{r fig.width= 4, fig.width=5}
all_trips_v2 %>% 
  group_by(member_casual, day) %>% 
  summarize(number_of_rides = n(), average_duration = mean(ride_length)) %>% 
  arrange(member_casual,day) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = day, y = average_duration,group = member_casual, color = member_casual)) + geom_line()
```
The graph above shows the big gap between casual and member type. casual users spent much more time per day in using bikes more than members.

*Usage of ride type based on ride length per month
```{r fig.width= 4, fig.width=5}
all_trips_v2 %>% 
  group_by(member_casual, month) %>% 
  summarize(number_of_rides = n(), average_duration = mean(ride_length)) %>% 
  arrange(member_casual,month) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = month, y = average_duration,group = member_casual, color = member_casual)) + geom_line()
```
Also we can see the result from table above, casual users spend much more time than member users per month using bike.

# My recommendations

*From the above results, we can see casual riders ride the most during weekends and from June to August (could be Summer time, people tend to use bikes more often). So different price strategy should be considered. That would be equivalent to the savings for those who make a change to annual membership.

*Also we can see the ride length of casual riders is higher than annual members in general. So it should be increase cost ride time for casual type.

*Our purpose to maximize the number of annual memberships, therefore take care of existing annual members is also crucial. For example, can conduct discount offers for monthly payment to an annual riders who introducing their friends or for existing casual riders who register as a member.
